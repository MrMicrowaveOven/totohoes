My bombers are both fatal/will, +60-65 spd, +10k HP, and 85 acc including the leader skill + artifacts. If you use Chasun/Fran, there's a small chance CD vigor hurts Malaka and then Skogul procs and kills it. So if you have a spare lv 40 Colleen, put her on shield will and she'll make sure that doesn't happen."
